## Setting

Primary objectives, one per player (destroy station, send secret data, protect the company, kill demon god)

## Design Philosphy

no dice-checks. just do stuff.
explore rooms -> kill things -> get key -> get to elevator -> DEATH
“Soft objectives” should feel like opportunities (unlock armory, send distress signal)

### Dice Mechanic

In general, rolling the highest possible on a die (6 on a d6, 12 on a d12) will give you a big bonus such as a "headshot" or the dice "explodes". Likewise, rolling a 1 will give you some kind of penalty.

  *Spawn Points **Health Points ***Headshots 

### Out of combat

When playing out-of-combat, the players say what their characters do ("I open the door", "I check for weapons"). There are no skill checks in 1991, your character simply can or can't do a thing and the GM decides if something is impossible to do.

### Combat

The moment things get hostile, combat begins. In combat players and enemies take turns doing actions such as strafing and shooting. If there are more than one player, they may choose their turn order. All players do their turn, then all enemies does theirs, and so on. The GM decides if the players were surprised, and if they were, the enemies start taking turns.

#### Adrenaline

Adrenaline (or ADR) represents how "in the zone" a character is. You gain **1 ADR** if any of the following happens:

- You attack an enemy
- You take damage

You lose **1 ADR** when the following happens:

- Go one turn in combat without attacking
- Leave a room without attacking an enemy (including if the room was empty)

Each class has an Adrenaline Skill Tree, where the characters gain skills depending on their level of adrenaline.

#### Actions

During your turn, you can take two actions from the list below. You may take the same action twice:

- Move
- Interact with environment
- Strafe
- Reload
- Equip weapon
- Attack

The actions are explained further below:

#### Move

This action represents all types of movement from point A to B. One movement action will usually take you across a room.

#### Interact with environment

This action represents opening doors, pushing buttons, picking up things and so on. Some interactions, such as searching a terminal for a password or bending open a malfunctioning door, may require more time than others, the GM decides the number of actions it will take, sometimes even multiple turns.

#### Strafe

Strafing represents moving in parallel to an enemy, avoiding their attacks. When you choose this action, you strafe until your next turn. **All damage to and from a strafing character is halved (rounded up)**.

#### Reload

A gun must sometimes be reloaded or unjammed, this action represents this. Each time this happens, you have to use up the amount of *clips* required to ready the weapon again.

#### Equip Weapon

You can only have one weapon equipped, to use a different weapon you have to choose this action.

### Attacking

#### Headshots

When attacking and rolling the highest amount with a weapon die, the character also deals 1 headshot. Most enemies can be killed with one headshot, some more.

#### Explode

Some skills and weapons give your dice the ability to "explode", this means that if you roll the highest possible on a die, you get to roll one more time and add your result to the last.

#### Armor

When a character takes damage, if they have armor, they roll their armor die. They then subtract the amount of damage that they roll. However, the armor breaks on **1** (and cannot be used again). If you roll the highest possible, you subtract all damage.

#### Line of sight

Players and enemies can only attack you they can see their targets. A character can be also be partly covered, in which the character only takes half of any damage taken (rounded up).
